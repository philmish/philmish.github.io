Hi, my name is phil. I am a nerd on the internet, writing useless code for recreational and educational purposes.
This is my blog/infodump/cheatsheet/whatever for all my learning and side-project related code. When ever I do a thing for which I want to document/track my progress I will write a blog.
Everything you read here is pretty much "learning-by-doing", so be aware that there might be incorrect information here.

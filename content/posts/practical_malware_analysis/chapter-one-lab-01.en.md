After being interested in the topic of Malware Reversing/Research for a while now and picking [Practical Malware Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Malware-Analysis-Hands-Dissecting/dp/1593272901/ref=sr_1_1?crid=35SRDR50C5VDR&keywords=practical+malware+analysis&qid=1700091659&sprefix=practical+malw%2Caps%2C169&sr=8-1) last month. I started working through it this week and, as of now, really enjoying it. The first chapter concentrates on the basics of static analysis of binaries. As the author states himself, a lot of the specifics in the book are now out of date. For example, the Labs are originaly designed for Windows XP. I will be running my static analysis from a Windows 10 VM, as it shouldn't make much of a difference for static. As soon as we get into dynamic analysis in Chapter 3 I will have a look into extending my virtual lab with a XP machine.  


## So, what are we doing ?

The book provides us with a collection of different Labs in the form of binary executable and library files. For each of these we are provided with a list of questions which should act as a guiding path through the analysis.

The first Lab actually provides us with 2 Files. An executable (.exe) file and a library file (.dll). Some of the tools suggested by the authori are still a good option, but 10 years after the book's release there is a lot of new and shiney tools to choose from. 

### Tools

For the first Lab we will not require a lot of tools. I decided for the following for basic static analysis of the provided file.

- [Detect it easy](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy)
- [PE Bear](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-bear)

## Questions

1. Upload the File to Virustotal. Check if there are existing Anti Virus signatures against this sample.
2. When were the files compiled ?
3. Is there any indication that any of these files is packed or obfuscated ? If so which are those indicators ?
4. Do any imports hint at what this malware does ? If so, which imports are they ?
5. Are there any other files or host-based indicators that you could look for on the infected systems ?
6. What network-based indicators could be used to find this malware on infected machines ?
7. What would you guess is the purpose of these files ?

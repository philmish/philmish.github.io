After falling down the rabbit hole of unpacking the previous sample, this one will be a bit shorter again.

## Questions


1. Are there any existing signatures for the sample on virus total ?
2. Are there indications that the file was obfuscated or packed ? If the file is packed, unpack it if possible.
3. When was the program compiled ?
4. Do any imports hint at the programs functionality ? If some which imports are they and what do they tell you ?
5. What host- and network-based indicators could be used to identify this malware on infected machines ?
6. This file has one resource in the resource section. Use resource hacker to examine that resource, and then use it to extract that resource. What can you learn from the resource ?

At first glance, the simple does not seem to be packed. The signature shown by `Detect it easy` identifies the sample as a 32-Bit Windows PE file.

So far so good.

We can already spot a lot of interesting stuff here.

The imports detected by are also quite interesting. We can see imports from `advapi.dll` which can be used to look up and adjust privileges on security token.
We also can see imports from `kernel32.dll` for opening processes (`OpenProcess`), creating threads in other processes (`CreateRemoteThread`), writing (`WriteFile`) and moving (`MoveFileA`) files as well as functionality which can be used to obtain a handle to a resource in memory (`LoadResource`)


The extracted strings contain an URL, `http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com/updater.exe`, which looks like a link to another executable file.
Also, there are two occurences the known string contained in the DOS header of Microsoft PE files, `!This program cannot be run in DOS mode.`

Taking a closer look at the output of `Detect it easy` we can see that there is a resource contained in the binary which itself is a 32-bit PE file.
This also explains the second occurences of known section names such as `.text`.

## Extracting the resource

The book mentions [Resource Hacker](https://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/) as a possible tool to be used to extract a resource, like icos, from binary files.
As I did't install it yet, I decided to take a more archaic approach by opening the sample in a Hex Editor, search for the `.rscr` section of the file and locate the Magic Bytes `MZ` to see where the attached PE File started.
After finding the location I just dumped all the bytes , beginning with `MZ`, to another file.


Loading the extracted file into `Detect it easy` shows us that this is indeed a 32-bit Windows PE file.

## Answers

1. There are existing signatures on VT. Most of them hint at a `Win32 Trojan/Download`
2. There seem to be no indicators that the sample is packed. But `detect it easy` shows us that a Win32 PE File is attached as a resource to the sample. After extracting it we can see that according to PE bear it is an executable. This might obfuscate the full functionality of the sample to people only looking at the `.text` section of the sample.
3. The File Header for the actual sample `Lab01-04.exe` shows a compilation timestamp of  `Friday, 30.08.2019 22:26:59 UTC`. The extracted resource shows a timestamp of `Sunday, 27.02.2011 00:16:59 UTC`.
4. The program's imports from `kernel32.dll` include functions for loading a executable file from memory with `LoadResource`, opening a process with `OpenProcess` as well as retrieving a handle to the current process with `GetCurrentProcess`. This could be used to run code attached to the resource section of the program. The sample also imports functionality for creating and moving Files on the system (`CreateFileA`, `MoveFileA`) which might be an indicator that the malware tries to persist itself on disk. Taking a look at the code extracted from the sample's resource we see that it uses `urlmon.dll` to import `URLDownloadToFileA`. This might be used to download the the `updater.exe` file from the URL found in the strings.
5. I found an URL in the extracted strings `http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com/updater.exe`, communication to this URL and the domain can be used to monitor the network for traffic to them
6. The extracted resource is a PE file itself, the extracted code contains imports from `urlmon.dll` which can be used to download a file from the internet (`URLDownloadToFileA`). The code also imports functions to retrieve the windows and temp directory as well as `WinExec`. It looks like the attached PE file from the resources is used to download a file and executing it on the system.
